    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
Who am I? I am Nicholas Verdi, born in New Jersey and raised in Florida. I am in a bootcamp online to become a full stack developer and enjoy it alot so far. To began, my grandfather had the oppurtunity to get in this feild at its start, but for one reason or more did not pursue it. Knowing this, it made me curious to know what was behind the door he left cracked open. Continuely, I am determined to increase my knowledge and learn my strengths and weaknesses, using everything I can to further in this "world". Othan than, I enjoy freetime with loved ones, D.C. Comics, and I can juggle.

    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <p>Currently im in a online bootcamp to gain the skills of a full stack web developer, but some of my past work experience include the following.</p>
    <h3>WaWa</h3>
    <p>Worked 3 years with Wawa as a store associate, feeling the best thing I gained from it was the increased customer service ability.</p>
    <h3>Amazon Delievery Driver</h3>
    <P>Current job for the last year and a half, where i learned alot about teamwork, given you're on the road by yourself, other drivers run into trouble and need other to help pick up their pace, which i've always accept to do. No one left behind, especially since we all have the same goal.</P>
